- **Modern JavaFX**: Responsive GUI development with contemporary design principles

### 🎯 Technical Highlights

- **Reactive UI Updates**: Implemented using the Observer Pattern for real-time game state synchronization
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular design with loosely coupled components
- **Event-Driven System**: Sophisticated event handling mechanism for user interactions
- **Custom Graphics Engine**: Advanced JavaFX implementation for game board visualization
- **State Management**: Robust game state handling with proper encapsulation

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Core Language**: Java 17
- **GUI Framework**: JavaFX 17
- **Build System**: Maven
- **Version Control**: Git
- **IDE Support**: VSCode with Java Development Kit
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit 5

       void squareChanged(Square square);
   }
   ```

2. **MVC Architecture**
   ```java
   public class GameController {
       private final Board model;
       private final GameView view;
       
       public void handleMove(int x, int y) {
           if (model.isValidMove(x, y)) {
               model.executeMove(x, y);
               view.updateBoard();
           }
       }
   }
   ```
